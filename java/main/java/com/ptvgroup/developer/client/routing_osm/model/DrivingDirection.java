Use this value to calculate which can be covered e.g. by an emergency service such as a fire department.  * &#x60;INBOUND&#x60; - Indicates an inbound routing from destination to start, i.e. from where the location can be reached within the given horizon. Use this value to calculate the catchment area, e.g. of a school or a hospital.
